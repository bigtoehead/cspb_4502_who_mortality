Project Title: World Heath Organization Mortality Investigations

Team Members: Bryan Arment, Jeff Dank, Tony Pearo

Description of the project: 
   We stumbled upon the World Health Organization's database of mortality. This database
is how the WHO keeps track of causes of death from countries that choose to report that
information to the WHO. Our particular dataset had over 3.5 million entries, with over
9000 various causes of death. Our goals was to clean up the dataset and organize it in 
such a way that we disvover new information from it. 

Summary of the questions sought and the answers:
    Question 1) How does mortality present itself in countries across the world?
    Answer   1) It seems to cluster together based upon how develped the nation is.
              With our K-means of k=3 analysis, this basic trend appeared to us. 

    Question 2) Can we make any predictions about future mortality?
    Answer   2) After plotting the cause of death groups over time. The all seemed very stable
                and linear. In other words, uninteresting. We decided to not pursue this quest
                any further after those plots were made. Our initial plan was to group a few
                years as trainng sets and the remainder as the test set. 

    Question 3) Can we identify groups of countries with similar mortality profiles.
    Answer   3) Yes, this trend did appear based upon level of country development and also 
                geographically. We figured this kind of information could be used by policy
                makers to stear their country in a more desired direction. 


Application of this knowledge:
    One application would be to perform further studies of a particular country that seemed
to be doing quite well in a specific cause of death group. We noted that France seemed to be
a geographic outlier due to its lower cardiovascular cause of death compared to its neighboring
European countries. Further research could dive into lifestyle habbits, purity of air and water,
and heath care policies. This could help other countries drive down their cardiovascular rate of 
death.
